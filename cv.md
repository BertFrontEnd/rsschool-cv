3. **Summary:**

Always wondered how the Web works. There is a great desire to master the "magic" of Front-end development, but there is no experience, skills and mentoring for the development vector. I like both UI/UX-design and layout with Front-end development. Therefore, I want to change my current occupation, find an internship to acquire the necessary skills and experience in the field of Web design and Web development with further employment.
